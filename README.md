# uber-trip-analysis
Uber has been a major source of travel living in urban areas. Some people don't have their vehicles while some don't drive their vehicles intentionally and different kind of people are using the services of uber. By analysing Uber trips, we can draw many patterns like which day has the highest and the lowest trips or busiest hour for Uber. The dataset I'm using here is based on Uber trips from New York.  The dataset contains data of about 4.5 million uber pickups in New York city from April to September and 14.3 million pickups from January to June 2015. So, I have prepared this data according to the days and hours, as I am using the Uber trips for the September month. There is analysis of data according to busiest day , hour and according to weekends.
